This extra shine is made possible by a slightly undulating leaf edge which helps to capture and reflect more light than a typical flat edged leaf. ‘Greensprite’ is 3-4’ tall evergreen shrub blooms in spring with small white, urn-shaped flowers borne on drooping racemes that are somewhat obstructed by the foliage. Drooping leucothoe requires moist acid soil and does best in a sheltered location with at least filtered shade. It can be used in the shrub border, as a facer plant with taller plants, or to stabilize banks. In winter, its leaves can develop a rich burgundy color. Good companions for Leucothoe fontanesiana ‘Greensprite’ include Pachysandra procumbens, Polystichum acrostichoides, Rhododendron maximum, Erythronium americanum, Polemonium reptans, and Phlox divaricata.","average, moist, wet "
