Our project is named Native Garden Designer, and is designed to help a beginner gardener easily build a garden full of native plants to support
butterflies and moths in our area.

### Starting Screen

On the starting screen, the user will see three buttons. One takes the user to the screen where you create your garden, one takes the user to a place to load gardens,
and one takes the user to a more info page where they can learn more about the importance of native plants.

### Garden Info Screen

After clicking on the info page button in the starting screen, the user will be able to read some information about the importance of native plants,
as well as be directed to some links to learn about native plants.

### Create New Garden Screen

The create new garden screen allows the user to drag around corners of the garden to define the shape. The user can also name the garden, as well as
set a budget, size, and check what sorts of soil, sun, and moisture their garden has.

### Main Screen

The main screen displays the user's currently active garden, and the user can see information about how many leps (butterflies and moths) their garden
support, how many plants it has, and how much of the space and budget is used. 

### Add Plants Screen

The add plants screen allows the user to look through the possible plants that may fit their garden, and determine which ones to add. The possible plants
can be sorted by a variety of factors, and the user can search for a specific plant.

### Edit Garden Screen

The edit garden screen allows the user to edit their current garden, as well as make some adjustments to its attributes. The user can drag new plants
to be placed into their garden, where they will be displayed according to their spread.

### Plants Screen

The plants screen allows the user to look through a list of plants they have currently added to their garden. The user can sort them and search for them in 
the same way as in the add plants screen. In addition, there is a more info button that takes the user to a screen with some more information.

### More Info Screen

The more info screen shows a larger picture of the plant and displays some information regarding the plant.

### Leps Screen

The leps screen shows a list of leps currently supported by the garden.

### Load Different Garden Screen

Load different garden allows the user to find a ``.gar`` file in your explorer to open a garden. In addition, some ``.gar`` files within the ``/gardens/``
folder are already displayed, and can be used as the current garden with one click.
